# ed8pkg2glb

Converts model data and texture data contained in ED8 `.pkg` files to GLTF binary format.

## Modding help and resources

See [Trails Research Group](https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group) for more resources to assist in modding the game.  

## Usage

First, download and extract the [Win32 version](https://github.com/uyjulian/ed8pkg2glb/releases/latest/download/ed8pkg2glb-win32.zip).  
Afterwards, drag and drop a single `.pkg` file onto the executable `ed8pkg2glb.exe`.  
`.glb` and `.dds` files will be output in the same directory as `.pkg`.  

## Output file information

The `.glb` file can be imported in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).  
Compatibility with other applications is not guaranteed due to the output file not completely adhering to the GLTF specification.  
Due to the fact that the game uses shaders for blending multiple UV layers, the output result may not look exactly as in the game.  

The `.dds` file is output in the native block compression format (e.g. DXT1 or BC7)  
At the time of writing, Blender does not support BC7 textures natively, so you will need to convert them with [TexConv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv).
