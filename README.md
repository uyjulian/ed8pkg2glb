# Trails of Cold Steel III / IV / into Reverie Model Toolset

This a tool set for making mods of character models in Trails of Cold Steel III, IV and into Reverie (Hajimari) for PC (DirectX 11).  It is built on top of uyjulian's ed8pkg2glb tool, which is [here](https://github.com/uyjulian/ed8pkg2glb).  I have not removed the functionality of producing gltf files, although those files are not used in the model compilation process.

## Tutorials:
See the [wiki](https://github.com/eArmada8/ed8pkg2gltf/wiki), and the documentation below.

## Credits:
The original phyre asset decompiler is written by Julian Uy (github.com/uyjulian), and I have only made modifications.  I wrote the remaining tools, and am very thankful to Arc, My Name, uyjulian, TwnKey and the Kiseki modding discord for their brilliant work and for sharing that work so freely.  I am especially thankful to Arc for sharing expertise in the compilation process and for spending many evenings helping me debug!  I am also very thankful to My Name for sharing models and knowledge as well.

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.9 or newer is required for use of this script.  It is free from the Microsoft Store, for Windows users.  For Linux users, please consult your distro.
2. The zstandard module for python is needed for decompiling zstandard-compressed pkgs.  The lz4 module is used for compressing compiled .pkgs.  Use of the glTF mesh exporter additionally requires numpy, pyquaternion and pygltflib.  Install all of these by running the included install_python_modules.bat or by typing "python3 -m pip install zstandard numpy pyquaternion pygltflib" in the command line / shell.
3. The output can be imported into Blender using DarkStarSword's amazing plugin: https://github.com/DarkStarSword/3d-fixes/blob/master/blender_3dmigoto.py
4. Compilation is dependent on the phyre Engine tools from [here](https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group/Doc/releases/download/v0.0/WorkFolder.zip), as described on the [tutorial from the Trails-Research-Group](https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group/Doc/wiki/How-to:-Import-custom-models-to-Cold-Steel-IV).  (You do not need the tutorial for basic mods, just the tools.)  The tools require [the Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/).

## Usage:

### Step 1: Decompilation
Obtain a model pkg file.  In CS3/CS4, the files are stored in assets.pka and must be extracted.  Use [extract_pka.py](https://github.com/eArmada8/unpackpka) in the same folder as assets.pka.

Place ed8pkg2gltf.py and lib_fmtibvb.py into a folder with your character model (.pkg) file.  Double-click ed8pkg2gltf.py.  It will create a folder with the same name as the pkg, and dump in there the model in gltf form, meshes for modding in a folder, textures in their own folder, and a metadata.json file.  (Note: Vertex group mapping behavior can be configured, see below.)

Note: If there is more than one .pkg file in the directory, the script will dump them all.

### Step 2: Modding

- Ignore the glTF file.  (Or use it for other purposes, but it is not used during compile.)  (***Note:*** v2.1.1 and above include an experimental glTF mesh dumper that can be used to convert glTFs to raw buffers and a skeleton metadata file.  This is ***not*** my recommended way to mod for most simple mods and will increase the complexity of the process, but will be useful for complex mods where the skeleton will be replaced.  See below.)

- There is a folder with the same name as the package, this is the build folder.  The asset_D3D11.xml file and compiled shaders reside here.  For simple mods, nothing here should be changed.

- Textures can be edited in the program of your choice.  If you add files and/or change file names, the metadata.json should be updated.  To see what texture formats are supported, run ```CSIVAssetImportTool.exe -?```  Note, however, that CS3, CS4 and Hajimari expect textures to be in DXT10 BC7_UNORM format (BC7 Linear, not sRBG) - the compiler will accept other formats (e.g. DXT1) but your texture may be horizontally flipped.  Per uyjulian, the original asset import pipeline horizontally flipped textures if they were not BC4, BC5, BC6, BC7 or ETC1.  While it is a pain, for best quality and fewer headaches, I recommend double-exporting from your image editing program in linear BC7 for the game and PNG for Blender.

- Meshes can be modified by importing them into Blender using DarkStarSword's plugin (see above).  Export when finished and overwrite the original files.  Note that meshes with more than 80 active vertex groups will disable GPU skinning (empty groups are okay as the compiler will cull empty groups from skin index of each individual mesh).  To remove a mesh, just delete the files (.fmt/.ib/.vb).  If adding a mesh, be sure it conforms to the existing skeletal map (.vgmap).  (***Note:*** Meshes dumped with this tool have remapped skeletons by default, so existing 3DMigoto meshes cannot be dumped in as-is.  You can either merge into a dumped mesh, or you can run the decompiler with the partial maps option to get meshes with original mapping.  The latter is probably preferred for converting mods since I have confirmed that otherwise you can literally replace the .fmt/.ib/.vb files {keep the .material, .uvmap and .vgmap files} for rapid mod conversion.)

- Material assignments can be changed by changing the .material file associated with the mesh.  Note that the material defines both the textures and the shader.  The build script will not accept any meshes without a .material file.

- New materials can be defined in the metadata (just be careful with commas - you may want to use a dedicated JSON editor).  We cannot make new shaders from scratch, however, so you will need to copy valid metadata (with matching shader hash etc).  To make a new material, copy the material you want from elsewhere (can be from the same character for example, or you can take from a different character) and give it a name that is unique to this model.  Change the textures to what you need (I am pretty sure that the texture *slots* are defined by the shader though - so for example if the shader you pick needs a normal map, you need to provide a normal map).  Update the .material file of the mesh you are assigning it to.  If this is a new shader to this model (i.e. you copied the metadata from a different model), then copy both the *unskinned* and *skinned* shaders to the build directory.  (Meshes / materials without skeletons will not have a skinned shader.)

### Step 3: Building a COLLADA .dae and compiling

For this step, put build_collada.py, lib_fmtibvb.py, replace_shader_references.py and write_pkg.py in the model directory (the directory with metadata.json).  You will also need to have the contents of WorkFolder.zip in your model directory.  (You need CSIVAssetImportTool.exe, all the PhyreAsset_____ files, PhyreDummyShaderCreator.exe, SQLite.Interop.dll and System.Data.SQLite.dll.  You do not need the shaders directory.)

-Double click build_collada.py.  It will make a .dae file, in the original compile folder as defined in asset_D3D11.xml (by default it is chr/chr/{model name}/).  It will also make a shaders/ed8_chr.fx file for compiling (and/or ed8.fx, etc), and a RunMe.bat.

-Double click RunMe.bat.  It will run the asset import tool, then it will use the dummy shader creator to identify all the shaders for replacement, then it will use replace_shader_references.py to fix all the shader pointers, and finally it will clean up, move everything to the build directory, and run write_pkg.py to generate your .pkg file.

## Notes

**Weight Painting:**

If you would like to weight paint the meshes, you will want to parent to the armature so you can see the results of your painting in Blender.  Import your raw meshes **and** the glTF.  Delete all the meshes from the glTF.  Select all your raw buffers in object mode, then shift-click on the bones (or ctrl-click up_point in the outliner window).  Go to Object menu -> Parent -> Armature Deform (do not select any of the "With" options).  Your meshes are now parented, but still can be exported as .fmt/.ib/.vb.  Note that this is necessary to keep all the original data of the buffers, since the glTF meshes are missing a lot of data and also cannot be exported directly as .fmt/.ib/.vb.  If you want to work with the glTF meshs without going through this parenting process, you can use the glTF extractor (see below).

**Command line arguments for ed8pkg2gltf.py:**

`ed8pkg2gltf.py [-h] [-p] [-o] pkg_filename`

`-h, --help`
Shows help message.

`-p, --partialmaps`
The default behavior of the script is to provide meshes and .vgmap files with the entire skeleton and every bone available to each mesh.  This will result in many empty vertex groups upon import into Blender.  (All empty groups will be removed at the time of compilation.)  This option will preserve the original mapping with the exact original indexing (such that the .vgmaps would correspond to and be compatible with buffers taken out of GPU memory, e.g. when using 3DMigoto).

`-o, --overwrite`
Overwrite existing files without prompting.

**Complete VGMap Setting:**

While most modders prefer that complete VGmaps is the default, you may want partial maps to be the default (for example to use existing 3dmigoto mods as a base).  You can (permanently) change the default behavior by editing the python script itself.  There is a line at the top:
`partial_vgmaps_default = False`
which you can change to 
`partial_vgmaps_default = True`
This will also change the command line argument `-p, --partialmaps` into `-c, --completemaps` which you would call to enable complete group vgmaps instead.

**Experimental glTF extractor**

extract_from_gltf.py is available for rapid conversion of existing assets in glTF form.  (For FBX, I recommend using [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) to get your assets into glTF, or you can try exporting glTF from Blender if all you need are the meshes.)  It will take the meshes out of the the gltf in .fmt/.ib/.vb/.vgmap format, and create a skeleton metadata.json.  Please note that quite a lot of information is lost in this process, although it seems to me that the Cold Steel games do not use any of the information that is lost (e.g. binormals).

Note that if you export the glTF from Blender, the meshes produced by extract_from_gltf.py are useable but the skeleton will be inaccurate.  (Blender does not export TANGENT by default; check "Tangent" (Data->Mesh->Tangent in the export window) while exporting to preserve the original tangents otherwise extract_from_gltf.py will auto-calculate tangents using the first UV map and the normals.  Exporting from Blender should be acceptable if you can use the original skeleton extracted by ed8pkg2gltf.py.  If you are using the meshes from noesis FBX, be sure to set the base node scale back to 1.00 (defaults to 0.01 for some reason).

To export the skeleton itself, you will need to export from Blender in FBX format, with leaf bones turned OFF (Armature->Add Leaf Bones should be *unchecked* in the export window).  Then use Noesis to convert the FBX to glTF.   The metadata.json file will need to be updated, only the 'heirarchy' section is immediately useable.  (To get an accurate skeleton into Blender in the first place, again use Noesis to convert the glTF from ed8pkg2gltf.py into FBX.  When importing into Blender, Armature->Ignore Leaf Bones, Force Connect Children and Automatic Bone Orientation must all be *unchecked*.)  Do not use the meshes from noesis FBX->glTF, as of the current version of noesis there is a bug that results in secondary UV map corruption.

Guide to fixing the metadata.json file after using the glTF extractor:
- ```name``` should be the internal name of the model, and should match the .inf filename.
- ```pkg_name``` should match the build folder name, so build_collada.py will know where to put all the files needed for RunMe.bat
- ```materials``` will be filled with empty (unuseable) placeholder entries.  Replace these with real material entries taken from the actual metadata.json files generated by ed8pkg2gltf.py.
- ```heirarchy``` should be useable without modification.  This is where the skeleton is - if the skeleton needs modification, modify it in the glTF before running extract_from_gltf.py instead.
- ```locators``` might or might not work without modification.  I suggest copying it over from the original metadata.json, unless the skeleton has been modified.

This tool extracts the glTF assets into its own folder, rather than overwriting all the files in the main folder if you happen to run it on the glTF that was dumped by ed8pkg2gltf.py.  After fixing the metadata, delete the original meshes/metadata and move the meshes and metadata.json files to the correct location.  Do not rely on overwriting for the meshes, as the glTF meshes have different names so you will end up with two sets of meshes in your model if you do not delete the originals.
